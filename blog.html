              Hello, welcome to my profile! I'm Elena Petkova and I've chosen to continue my education at the HZ
              University of
              Applied Sciences. My study choice in the university is the HBO-ICT programme.
              <br>
              <p>
                Here are links for more info about the unversity and the programme: <a href="https://hz.nl/en">HZ University of Applied Sciences</a> and <a href="https://hz.nl/en/study-programmes/it">HBO-ICT programme</a>
              </p>
          </td>
          <td>
              Having in mind that the programme includes different courses, which are useful for my development as a
              student, I
              think that it also has a lot of oppoirtunities for various jobs and it could expand my knowledge and gain
              skills
              for creating big and real projects. And it's a suitable programme for me, because I have interest in the
              field of
              IT and also want to continue to one of the three paths that it offers.
