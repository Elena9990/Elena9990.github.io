        <h3>
          <li>Who am I?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          So, a few months ago I just graduaded highschool and decided to continue my study path with taking higher
          education
          at the HZ University of Applied Sciences. So, now I'm taking the challenge of living abroad and studying in a
          language different than mine. But why did I choose it to be like that? Because why not trying taking diverse
          opportunities around the world :)
        </p>
        <h3>
          <li>Why exactly the HZ University?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The main reason for my choice for me to have my studies in the Netherlands is the educational system which
          gives numerous opportunities for the students. For instance, the international experience and all the practice
          that is put into the process
          of learning. Also, I like getting out of my comfort zone and the challenge of moving to another country seemed
          to be a big step in my life, so I decided to make it.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <li>Why is ICT for me?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Firstly, I've always been interested in computers in some way. At first I wasn't really sure what exatly
          attracted me to them, but a few years ago I descovered my desire to create things like apps, presentations,
          designs, games, etc. And for a creative and logical thinking person like me, the program would definitely help
          to me improve my creative talents, and it could also help me with the deeper understanging of computer
          science. So,
          in that way I will have the right knowledge which will give me the possibility make projects from which I am
          going to benefit from. But it's not going to be only me who's going to benefit from it, but the world as well.
