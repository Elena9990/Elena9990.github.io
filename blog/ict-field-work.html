      emerging virtual platforms like the metaverse. It primarily uses technologies such as AI, machine learning, data

    </p>
    <p>
      Facebook has been a big part of my life, because I've had a profile there since I was a child and I've been so
      curious how everything in the app is just made. For instance, the fact that you can find so many poeple and see
      everything about them is quite interesting to see how it is done. The other reason that I would like to work in
      the company would be that it could give me a lot of marketing and coding experience. Another opportunity that I
      would add is that I can improve the system as well and be a part of that large team. Also, I'd like to see how all
      the information about all the users has been used and where exactly it goes.

    </p>
    <p>
      There are several reasons because of which I would like to work for YouTube. Firtly, it's been improving all the
      time and I as a user can say that it's always been intriguing to see the changes and actually think of a way to
      make some on my own. I would like to try to improve the desgin and to add more options to the platform. Also, I'd
      like to see the whole process "behind the scenes", for example, how they make the mecahcnism of approving the
      videos and how the regulations are being implemented.
