    <h3 id="my-choice-header">Study choice activities</h3>
    <p>What have I previously done in the ICT field? I have perticipated in different presentations in front our school
      and we have done a lot of projects connected with design. I have been to a
      podcast conference where I saw a lot of motivated people who wanted to do something big in the IT field.</p>
    <h3 id="my-choice-header">Motivate your study choice </h3>
    <p>My decision for picking up the ICT program was taken, because of the knowledge given through it. With its power I
      can grow and develop in the IT sector pretty well and that means that the opportunities and the benefits from
      taking this particular program are large. Eventually, it gives the opportunity for the students to decide what
      their best side is â€“ the technical or the business one.</p>
    <h3 id="my-choice-header">After completing the study... </h3>
    <p>
      I wouldn't say that I have a clear plan about what I am going to do after finshing the programme, but I am sure
      that I'd like to try different things like being a game developer or a ux designer. The future will show what
      exactly of the IT field I will choose to be in.
    </p>
    <h3 id="my-choice-header">How did it all start?</h3>
    <p>Everything started with me being curious about all the colorful stuff on the computers (games, sites,
      presentations, etc.). Since I was little, I've always wanted to create something interesting and big like a game,
      site or an app and that was one of the reasons for me to start thinking about what I should study. Then I decided
      to study in the IT class in my previous school, so there I did a lot of projects and I was so determined to make
      them interesting. All of my schoolwork inspired me even more to continue with the subject of IT.</p>
