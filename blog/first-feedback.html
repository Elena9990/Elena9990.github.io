      <h4>
        This feedback is from Paula Tavares Leitao Waaijenberg (ICT lecturer) for my "Who am I?" assignment
      </h4>
      <p>
        "Reading your motivation, I noticed you are already familiar with some aspects of software development and even
        has a
        preference for front end. Our program for the first year focuses mostly on programming (HTML, JavaScript,
        TypeScript, Laravel Framework) and that will give you the base to become a developer. Besides coding, we also
        work
        on your professional development exploring 4 main competences: 'Interact purposefully', 'Research-oriented
        problem-solving', 'Future-oriented organizing' and 'Personal leadership'. It is also good that you are already
        thinking about Software Engineering. During the second year you will get better acquainted with Business IT
        Consultancy and Data Science and will have the chance to make a definitive choice.
      <p>
        From your SWOT analysis: you mention you are a good communicator, this will come handy when working with the
        various
        team project assignments. Perfectionism can be positive thing when your invest in going for the best results.
        But
        experience will teach that sometime you donâ€™t have the means or the time to do it all and will need to make
        choices
        and prioritise. It is not that you are delivering a bad product, but a leaner one. Maybe it can help to give
        yourself a timebox when you really want to work further on an improvement. You can plan one or two hours of work
        in
        advance, but stick to it: done is done, even if it could have been better."
      </p>
      <h4>My feedback from students</h4>
      <p>There was a feedback that I also received from students. What they said was that maybe changing the design of
        my home page woudld be better, as well as that they stated that I should change some of the links put on the
        pages and make them open in a different widnow and not in the one that my site is on, so the visitor of the site
        stays focused on my site. Also some of them suggested that changing some of my design elements would make the
        site a better. </p>
      <p>
      <h4>My thoughts about the feedbacks</h4>
      <p>
        When it comes to the first feedback, I think that prioritizing things works way more than being undecisive about
        wheter I should spend more time on the details or continue with the more important stuff. And about the feedback
        from the students, I think that what they suggested me to do is vital and I took it into account. The only thing
        that I took into account, but didn't really change is the design elements. But they were right about changing
        the home page;
