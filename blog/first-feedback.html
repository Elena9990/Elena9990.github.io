    This feedback is from Paula Tavares Leitao Waaijenberg (ICT lecturer) for my "Who am I?" assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
    Reading your motivation, I noticed you are already familiar with some aspects of software development and even has a
    preference for front end. Our program for the first year focuses mostly on programming (HTML, JavaScript,
    TypeScript, Laravel Framework) and that will give you the base to become a developer. Besides coding, we also work
    on your professional development exploring 4 main competences: 'Interact purposefully', 'Research-oriented
    problem-solving', 'Future-oriented organizing' and 'Personal leadership'. It is also good that you are already
    thinking about Software Engineering. During the second year you will get better acquainted with Business IT
    Consultancy and Data Science and will have the chance to make a definitive choice.
    <p>
    From your SWOT analysis: you mention you are a good communicator, this will come handy when working with the various
    team project assignments. Perfectionism can be positive thing when your invest in going for the best results. But
    experience will teach that sometime you donâ€™t have the means or the time to do it all and will need to make choices
    and prioritise. It is not that you are delivering a bad product, but a leaner one. Maybe it can help to give
    yourself a timebox when you really want to work further on an improvement. You can plan one or two hours of work in
    advance, but stick to it: done is done, even if it could have been better.
