            <h3 id="profile-info"> Inner me </h3>
            <p>
               You've likely come across information about my studies on the other pages, but what about the inner me?
               I'm a person who loves socializing and hanging out with people and I love being the funny person in the
               friend's group. Another typical thing about me is that I spend quite a lot time watching different things
               like videos, series and movies, some of which you can check below in this page :)
            </p>
            <h3 id="profile-info">So, what about my hobbies?</h3>
            <p>
               There are several hobbies that I have and the one that I do almost every day is walking around the
               town. Sometimes I do it for 1 or 2 hours without stopping. This is the best way of relaxation for me,
               also it keeps me in a good shape. The other physical activity that I like is dancing. I do not
               practice it that often, but I enjoy it so much every single time I do it. Sport took a big part of my
               life, because I used to be a cheerleader for about 7 years and then I used to do karate for a year.
               And all those years of training have given me discipline and have toughen me up. Also, I have met a
               lot of people throughout those years and I have learned how to be a part of a team. When it comes to
               the competitions that I participated in, I understood that even there's a failure I shouldn't give up,
               then understand my mistakes and not repeat them again.
