            <li> Question #10: </li>
         </b>
         <p style="width:900px; margin:0px;">
            <i> What do you see yourself doing after completing the program? For example what profession or role
               interests
               you? why? and what do you hope to have learned in four years? </i>
         </p>

         <p style="width:900px;">
            I have always been interested in working in the IT sector. And in the last few years, while doing some
            school
            projects, I have established that a profession connected with front end development, UI design or game
            development/design would be a suitable one for me. The reason why I am speciffically interested in that is
            because
            at school we've done a lot of projects which require a lot of creativity and a lot of design. And for now, I
            could
            say that this has intrigued me the most from what I have done all these years at school. It has been the
            design
            of
            the apps we have created, presentations, sites, etc. When it comes to game development/design, I would
            choose
            this
            as well, because there I could use various ideas for different aspects - coding, creativity, logic, etc..
            So,
            the
            profession that I would probably choose would be a front end developer, UI designer or a game
            developer/designer.
         </p>

         <p style="width:900px;">
            For taking such jobs, I would need some programming skills, which I believe I will gain, while completing
            this
            program, at a high level, so that it helps me with my future career and projects. Furthermore, I think I
            will
            learn how to work for a real company, concerning that as a student I will have to choose a place for taking
            an
            internship in which to apply my knowledge in a practical way. For example, learning how to develop/build an
            app.
            This also means that I will improve my IT business skills in a way, because even if I do not choose this
            career
            path (Business IT consultant), I will have to work with clients and find a solution for their problems. But
            those
            are not the only things that I expect to learn in these four years. I think I will improve in how to
            communicate
            in the right way with any types of people. This means clients and team workers. If I cannot have a good
            interraction with them in a professional way, then things would become a bit more complicated and it would
            cost
            a
            lot to get things done. And, of course, except all the subjects I will have and get knowledge from, I will
            see
            which is my best side - the technical or the business one.

            <i>
               <li>Do you have a (part-time) job?: Yes/ <u>No </u></li>

            </b>
            <i> What are your strengths?</li> </i>
         <p style="width:900px;">
            The first thing that comes to my mind as a strength of mine is being a good communicator. This is the thing
            that
            has helped me a lot with my school projects, because I know how to make people give their own ideas and
            opinions
            about a project and not be passive when it comes to working on it. In this way everyone performs a required
            task
            and the work is separated equally. Also, this ability contributes to choosing the accurate teammates when
            forming
            a team.
         </p>
         </p>

         <p style="width:900px;">
            The other powerful strength I have is my creative and critical thinking. When I have an assignment, I always
            think
            of something original that can make my project different from the others. And this is not the only reason, I
            also
            look for the extravagant idea or detail which will make it intriguing to watch or check. Because it may be
            original, but not interesting. But if I want this task to be performed like that, I need to see whether it
            is
            possible to do it in that way. As well as this, I need to check if those ideas of mine match the true
            concept
            and
            to see if there's something to improve or fix. Therefore, the evaluation of all the ideas and work are
            really
            important, so that the job is done well.
         </p>

               <li>Question #13 </li>
            </b>
            <b> Weaknessess </b>

            <i>
               <li>What are your weaknesses? </li>
            </i>
         <p style="width:900px;">
            The biggest obstacle for my work is being stressed over little and sometimes unimportant things. There are
            moments
            when I am stressed out because of my perfectionism for those details that probably only a few people would
            pay
            attention to. And this leads to thoughts which make me think if everything is fine and good enough, so that
            it
            is
            accepted well. Eventually, this ends when I get the final critics by those who are supposed to approve of
            it.
            So
            far, this has been changing in a good way and little by little these worries disappear and start being
            replaced
            by
            tranquility.
         </p>

         <p style="width:900px;">
            The perfectionism mentioned above sometimes consumes a lot of time and energy. Losing track of time because
            of
            it
            has its cost, because all the extra things are done, but the main part needs to be done as well. That
            doesn't
            mean
            that there's no plan how things will be done or the main point and concepts are not clear. It means that I
            could
            do it a bit faster and prioritize the most important parts being done first. However, I manage to do the
            projects
            for the deadline given.

            <br>
            <i> Which opportunities do you see? </i>
         <p style="width:900px;">
            The field of opportunities seems to be a huge one, because it is not only the knowledge I will gain in those
            four
            years, but also the skills I will obtain. Once I know how to use them practically, I will manage to work for
            bigger projects. They are those which will help me with adding experience to my CV and this is a huge chance
            for
            me to be chosen to work with really smart people around the world. And the good and challenging part of all
            this
            is that I will have the chance to do that during my internship while having my studies at the university.
            Having
            this in my CV even before finishing my studies is also a big plus for me, because I will be prepared in many
            ways
            for the following years.

         <p style="width:900px;">
            There are several hobbies that I have and the one that I do almost every day is walking around the town.
            Sometimes
            I do it for 1 or 2 hours without stopping. This is the best way of relaxation for me, also it keeps me in a
            good
            shape. The other physical activity that I like is dancing. I do not practice it that often, but I enjoy it
            so
            much
            every single time I do it. Sport took a big part of my life, because I used to be a cheerleader for about 7
            years
            and then I used to do karate for a year. And all those years of training have given me discipline and have
            toughen
            me up. Also, I have met a lot of people throughout those years and I have learned how to be a part of a
            team.
            When
            it comes to the competitions that I participated in, I understood that even there's a failure I shouldn't
            give
            up,
            then understand my mistakes and not repeat them again.
