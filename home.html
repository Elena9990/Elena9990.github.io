    <h3>What about me?</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, welcome to my profile! I'm Elena Petkova and I've chosen to continue my education at the HZ University of
      Applied Sciences. My study choice in the university is the HBO-ICT programme.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>What's my view on the programme?</h2>
    <p>
      Having in mind that the programme includes different courses, which are useful for my development as a student, I
      think that it also has a lot of oppoirtunities for various jobs and it could expand my knowledge and gain skills
      for creating big and real projects. And it's a suitable programme for me, because I have interest in the field of
      IT and also want to continue to one of the three paths that it offers.
